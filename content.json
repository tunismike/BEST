It\u2019s harder to sort and wets other recyclables, making for messy pickup and handling. Even when dry, the cardboard fibers become brittle and crumbly, making it much less valuable.\n\nFire - Another Public Adversary\nIt can take just 30 seconds for a small flame to turn into a major blaze. There\u2019s a yearly average of 358,300 home-based fires, causing an estimated at $15.9 billion in property damage.\n\nWater Destroys\nPaper loses strength when wet.

    "description": "Cellulose is an organic compound and the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. It is an important structural component of green plants used in manufacturing paper and cardboard products. Around 90% of shipped products in the US are packaged in cardboard.\n\nVirgin pulp is made only by using cellulose, meaning it does not contain any recycled content and is made directly of the pulp of trees or cotton. Papers and tissue papers that are produced with virgin pulp is categorized as high-quality products.\n\nThe properties of cellulose make it attractive as a substitute for plastics. However, the challenge with cellulose is its water content and absorption, which can contribute to its degradation leading to poor mechanical properties and reduced product life.\n\nWhat is needed is a way to strengthen the cellulose at the molecular level, which historically has been a complex phenomenon."

    "description": "Today\u2019s cardboard technology involves a combination of recycled material as well as new cellulose that comes from harvesting new wood. It is pulped (mixed with chemicals and water) and filtered to remove impurities (a waste product). Then it is blended with additional new material, placed on a conveyer belt, and blasted with heat. As it dries, it is pressed and glued together.\n\nCardboard takes approximately 12 months to completely decompose. While it can break down fairly quickly when exposed to the elements, stacks of cardboard can take years to decompose. When placed in landfills, it deteriorates and chemically breaks down, releasing methane as it decomposes. Methane can impact the environment 20 times more than carbon dioxide."

    "description": "Dr. Robert Morton is the Chief Technology Officer for Be Sustainable Technologies (BEST), LLC, the leader in performance enhancing paper products. BEST promotes technologies that enhance the stewardship of the environment with products designed for sustainability.\n\nDr. Morton has worked in American industry for over 45 years. He was the chief materials scientist at Phillips 66 for 30 years. While at Phillips 66, Dr. Morton received 24 patents and discovered the chemistry that drives regenerable materials that remove sulfur from petroleum products. He is also responsible for the development of standard analytical methods that are used by the U.S. EPA and other agencies worldwide to determine the ultra-low levels of sulfur in fuels that protect our environment. His early research led to the development of new x-ray spectrometers and diffractometers used commercially worldwide. He was an early pioneer in elemental x-ray imaging (commonly referred to as XRF imaging) and contributed to the recovery of the lost works of Archimedes as well as imaging the Archaeopteryx. The use of elemental x-ray imaging showed that Archimedes had originated the idea of infinity and also proved that the Archaeopteryx was once a living animal that had barbed flight feathers. In addition, elemental x-ray imaging of fossils demonstrated for the first time that the biological chemistry of the past is directly related to the biological chemistry of today.\n\nDr. Morton has worked as an industrial chemist since 1977.  He received his B.S. degree in Chemistry from Missouri Western State College in 1979 and Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City in 1987. His favorite area of Chemistry is formulation science which he was first exposed to while working for Hillyard Chemical Company in the 1970s. There are many areas of science one can specialize in but, formulation science has a direct impact on the quality of life for everyone worldwide."
