    "description": "Vulnerable to Moisture: Recycled cardboard used in railroad cargo packaging cannot sustain or resist moisture for extended transit periods. Rain, humidity, and condensation during rail transport weaken cardboard, causing it to lose structural integrity and fail to protect goods. This leads to damaged cargo, insurance claims, and wasted materials."

This creates enormous waste volumes, contributes to landfill burden, and represents poor economics. The inability to reuse packaging drives up per-shipment costs and increases the industry's environmental footprint."

Sparks from rail friction, electrical issues, or external fires can ignite cardboard packaging, potentially destroying entire freight loads and creating dangerous conditions. Fire-resistant packaging materials are critical for rail safety."

    "category": "Products - Retail",
    "description": "Vulnerable to Moisture: Cardboard pallets can neither sustain nor resist moisture for long periods. They cannot be stored outside or in humid environments. Exposure to rain, spills, or warehouse condensation causes them to weaken, warp, and potentially collapse. This makes them unreliable for retailers who need consistent supply chain performance in all conditions."

    "title": "Retail Pallets: Problem - Reliability vs. Wood",
    "category": "Products - Retail",
    "description": "Not as Reliable as Wooden Pallets: Cardboard pallets have a tendency to buckle or collapse under heavy cargo loads. Their load-bearing capacity diminishes significantly when exposed to any moisture or sustained weight over time. This unreliability compared to wooden pallets has been a major barrier to adoption, even though cardboard is more sustainable and cost-effective."

    "category": "Products - Retail",
    "description": "Not Particularly Hygienic: The absorbent nature of cardboard prevents proper sanitization, creating a risk of product contamination. In food, pharmaceutical, and retail supply chains, hygiene is critical. Untreated cardboard can harbor bacteria, mold, and other contaminants that transfer to products, making it unsuitable for industries with strict sanitation requirements."

    "description": "Vulnerable to Legal Issues: Flimsy or weakened pallets can result in safety incidents, injuries, or fatalities in warehouse and retail environments. Collapsed pallets can cause falling merchandise, forklift accidents, and worker injuries. This exposes companies to lawsuits, regulatory fines, workers' compensation claims, and reputational damage."
